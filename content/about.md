I am a technology enthusiast who has a degree in film. Right out of school I got a job working at a broadcast facility working on video compression for mastering and VOD delivery. After a couple years I changed roles within the same company to become a systems administrator for the media asset management system handling several petabytes of data across multiple storage tiers. It was a fun challenge working on improving the system and making the content available for remote global production. I currently work as a Cloud Solutions Architect.
