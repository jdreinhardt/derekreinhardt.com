I guess to start I am a technology enthusiast who went to school for film. It seems like an odd combination, but I found many different ways to pull the two fields together. It might have had something to do with my computer science courses that I took along the way. Right out of school I got a job working at a broadcast facility working on video compression for mastering and VOD delivery. After a couple years I changed roles within the same company to become a systems administrator for the media asset management system handling approximately eight petabytes of data across multiple storage tiers. It was a fun challenge working on improving the system and making the content available for remote global production. I currently work as a Project Engineer for a well-known media software company.

This site has evolved over the years. Several years ago I had a blog where I would take some of the more abstract technical aspects of film technology and try and explain them in laymans terms. It worked alright, but I never had the time, and it made me realize how little I knew at the time. I would like to think I've learned more since then, but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯. I then moved to a personal domain mostly as a page for my video reel in attempts to get work <sup>(which didn't work)</sup>. I had a little blog I ran on that site which is the basis for what exists now.

I debated bringing back a new iteration of my old blog, but decided that wasn't something I really wanted to do. I wanted to make something that was for me, so the things you might find here in the future could be related to anything from film, to programming, to other cool things that I find or experiment with. Do not expect this to contain events happening in my life. That is what a journal is for, not the internet.

Enjoy.
