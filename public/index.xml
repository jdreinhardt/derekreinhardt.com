      <description>I guess to start I am a technology enthusiast who went to school for film. It seems like an odd combination, but I found many different ways to pull the two fields together. Might have had something to do with my computer science courses that I took along the way. Right out of school I got a job working at a broadcast facility working on video compression for mastering and VOD delivery.</description>

      <description>Frost is the simplest way to render ProRes 422 files and H.265 files on Windows. It has been designed to give you a lot of control without having to know all the command line flags to render using FFmpeg.
Frost Requirements  A Windows operating system (7 or higher, but should work in XP) A copy of the FFmpeg binary .NET 4.0 or higher  Download Here
What Frost does is allow you to render any file you want to ProRes on the Windows platform, complete with options to rescale the video, remove the audio, and copy timecode over to the rendered file.</description>

      <title>Filmmaking and Open Source</title>

      <description>I have a crazy idea. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it will work, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and see if I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a reality. I want to make an open-source film, in a fashion I don&amp;rsquo;t think has been attempted.
I should probably explain what open-source is before I get to far ahead of myself. Open-source is a concept that is heavily used in the programming world. The idea is that all of the source code for a program is available for anyone to download and tweak however they want.</description>

      <description>Windows 10 has been out for a little over 4 months now. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it installed on a vitual machine since then. I like to see what&amp;rsquo;s coming, and get a grasp on it. In the past, with Windows 7, 8, and the 8.1, and the 10 (up to now) betas that is all I&amp;rsquo;ve every done. Then my desktop started giving me problems.
Let me lay a little bit of ground work.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that I have completed the next version on a pet project I have been working on for a long time. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been working on it non-stop, in fact it sat for a couple of years, but either way it is now here, better than ever.
What is it you ask? A ProRes and H.265 encoder for Windows. I call it Frost.
You can download it at https://www.</description>

      <description>I just finished up work on a production last week. It was a great project that will is in the editing room right now. I had some fun designing the workflow for this project, and I will probably right about it in the future because it was a system that I had never tried before and it worked near flawlessly. Instead of that though I wanted to write about something a little more technical today.</description>
