      <description>I have a crazy idea. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it will work, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and see if I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a reality. I want to make an open-source film, in a fashion I don&amp;rsquo;t think has been attempted.
I should probably explain what open-source is before I get to far ahead of myself. Open-source is a concept that is heavily used in the programming world. The idea is that all of the source code for a program is available for anyone to download and tweak however they want.</description>

      <description>Windows 10 has been out for a little over 4 months now. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it installed on a vitual machine since then. I like to see what&amp;rsquo;s coming, and get a grasp on it. In the past, with Windows 7, 8, and the 8.1, and the 10 (up to now) betas that is all I&amp;rsquo;ve every done. Then my desktop started giving me problems.
Let me lay a little bit of ground work.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that I have completed the next version on a pet project I have been working on for a long time. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been working on it non-stop, in fact it sat for a couple of years, but either way it is now here, better than ever.
What is it you ask? A ProRes and H.265 encoder for Windows. I call it Frost.
You can download it at https://www.</description>

      <description>I just finished up work on a production last week. It was a great project that will is in the editing room right now. I had some fun designing the workflow for this project, and I will probably right about it in the future because it was a system that I had never tried before and it worked near flawlessly. Instead of that though I wanted to write about something a little more technical today.</description>
