      <article class="post-content">
      <p>I guess to start I am a technology enthusiast who went to school for film. It seems like an odd combination, but I found many different ways to pull the two fields together. Might have had something to do with my computer science courses that I took along the way. Right out of school I got a job working at a broadcast facility working on video compression for mastering and VOD delivery. I currently work as a systems administrator at the same facility for the media asset management system handling approximately eight petabytes of data across multiple storage tiers. It&rsquo;s been a fun challenge working on improving the system and making the content easily available for remote global production.</p>

<p>This site has evolved over the years. Several years ago I had a blog where I would take some of the more abstract technical aspects of film technology and try and explain them in laymans terms. It worked alright, but I never had the time, and realized that I didn&rsquo;t know a whole lot then. Not that I know much more now, but at least I pretend. I then moved to a personal domain mostly as a page for my video reel in attempts to get work. I had a little blog I ran on that site which is what I have kept in moving to the current state.</p>

<p>I debated bringing back a new iteration of my old blog, but decided that wasn&rsquo;t something I really wanted to do. I wanted to make something that was for me, so the things you might find here in the future could be related to anything from film, to programming, to other cool things that I find, or experiment with. Do not expect this to contain events happening in my life. That is what a journal is for, not the internet.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
