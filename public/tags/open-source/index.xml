      <description>I have a crazy idea. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it will work, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and see if I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a reality. I want to make an open-source film, in a fashion I don&amp;rsquo;t think has been attempted.
I should probably explain what open-source is before I get to far ahead of myself. Open-source is a concept that is heavily used in the programming world. The idea is that all of the source code for a program is available for anyone to download and tweak however they want.</description>
